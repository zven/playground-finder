A higher value therefore leads to a less frequent retrieval of your devices location. Example: If you've set to 10 Minutes, this means a new location is at maximum retrieved every 10 Minutes. In the meantime the previously retrieved location is used, which of course it might up to 10 Minutes old, which could potentially degrade the service quality.",
